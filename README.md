This repository contains a consolidated project charter for a series of four projects focused on harnessing the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate realistic handwritten digits similar to those in the MNIST dataset. Each project delves deeper into the nuances of GAN architectures and adversarial training, with the goal of synthesizing high-quality MNIST digit images.
